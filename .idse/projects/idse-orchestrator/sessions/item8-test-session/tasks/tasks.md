# Tasks

[P] = parallel safe

## Instructions
- Derive tasks directly from the implementation plan and contracts.
- For each task, note owner, dependencies, and acceptance/validation notes.
- Keep tasks independent and testable; mark parallelizable tasks with [P].
- **These tasks guide the IDE/development team** - they describe what needs to be done, not where code should be written.

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- [ ] Task 0.1 – ... (Owner: ...) (Deps: ...) (Acceptance: ...)
- [ ] Task 0.2 – ...

## Phase 1 – Core Behavior
- [ ] Task 1.1 – ...
- [ ] Task 1.2 – ...

## Phase 2 – NFRs / Hardening
- [ ] Task 2.1 – ...
- [ ] Task 2.2 – ...
