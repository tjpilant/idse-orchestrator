# IDSE Pipeline Awareness for idse-orchestrator

This project uses IDSE (Intent-Driven Systems Engineering).

## Pre-Code Checklist

Before generating ANY code:
1. Check if `.idse/` directory exists
2. Read current session: `cat .idse/projects/idse-orchestrator/CURRENT_SESSION`
3. Read pipeline documents in THIS ORDER:
   - intents/intent.md (WHAT and WHY)
   - contexts/context.md (Constraints and requirements)
   - specs/spec.md (Technical specifications)
   - plans/plan.md (Implementation strategy)
   - tasks/tasks.md (Specific tasks to complete)

## Code Generation Rules

- Your code MUST align with these documents
- Follow the plan exactly as written
- Don't add features not in the spec
- Don't deviate from the implementation strategy

## Three-Tier Reasoning (Condensed)

Every code change must trace: Artifact (evidence) -> Component (realization) -> Primitive (authority).
- Declare all created/modified components in `implementation/README.md`
- Name the parent primitive for every component you touch
- If you cannot trace to a primitive, stop and ask
- Read your profile from `agent_registry.json` for full tier access rules

## Post-Code Documentation

After coding:
- Update `implementation/README.md` with what you built
- Add lessons learned to `feedback/feedback.md`
- Update `tasks.md` to mark completed tasks
